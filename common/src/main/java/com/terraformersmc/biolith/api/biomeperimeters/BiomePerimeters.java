/**
 * BiomePerimeters
 * <p/>
 * This class builds a bidirectional hashed list of the points (voxels) on the perimeter of a biome instance.
 * The points are used to provide an estimate of how far "in-biome" a given biome voxel is.  This can allow
 * biome generation (f.e. surface builders) to blend with surrounding biomes or generate context-sensitive
 * terrain heights within a particular biome.
 * <p/>
 * Note:  In order to achieve acceptable performance in-game, BiomePerimeters makes heavy use of caching and
 * also accepts certain compromises with respect to the accuracy of the perimeter distance values.  It is safe
 * to call getPerimeterDistance() for every individual block column during generation, but on the other hand,
 * minor discontinuities and variations may occasionally occur in the distance values.
